# Frontend redesign reference (Google Stitch exports)

This folder holds the source-of-truth design files Daniel produced in
Google Stitch on June 25, 2026, for the "Vitesse de France" redesign of
Home, My Team, and Riders. These are reference files only — nothing
here is wired up or imported by the running app. They exist so a
future session (or a future you) can rebuild the real templates
without losing the actual visual spec.

- **`DESIGN.md`** — the shared design system: color tokens, typography
  (Barlow Condensed / Inter / JetBrains Mono), spacing, shape, and
  component conventions used across all three pages. Read this first.
- **`home/`**, **`my-team/`**, **`riders/`** — one folder per
  redesigned page, each containing:
  - `code.html` — the actual exported markup (Tailwind CDN + inline
    config). This is the literal source of truth for layout and
    styling — more reliable than the screenshot, since Stitch's
    preview screenshots sometimes capture a font-loading race
    condition (overlapping text) that isn't present in the real
    rendered HTML.
  - `screen.png` — a static preview image, useful for a quick visual
    glance but not authoritative over `code.html`.

**What this folder does NOT cover:** whether the data each page wants
to show actually exists in the backend. That gap analysis (per-rider
scoring, editable team names, stage names, etc.) lives in the main
`README.md` under "Project Roadmap → Phase E" — read both together
when implementing.
